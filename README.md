# Express Async Example

This example demonstrates using Express with both error-first callbacks and promise-based APIs, both of which are common in the database world.  This also shows how redirects and direct rendering can wait on an async database response.

To run:

```
npm install
node app
```

Just connect to localhost:5555 with your browser.
